Dataset S1 . This Matlab dataset contains the onsets of the participants’ taps, following the ‘debouncing’ procedure described in Material and Methods. The structure contains one entry for each dyad, and is divided in two fields (‘subject1’, ‘subject2’). Each field contains a cell with 4 entries, one for every experimental condition (1-‘Visually Coupled’, 2-‘Visually Uncoupled’, 3-‘Auditorily Coupled’, 4-‘Auditorily Uncoupled’). The dataset is loaded by the Matlab Script S1, and goes through the processing pipeline as descripted in Figure 2 (see main manuscript). 

Dataset S2 (GitHub repository). This Matlab dataset contains the onsets of the metronomes. They are used to provide a ‘ground truth’ for the expected behavior of the system, and to guarantee the alignment of the behavioral timeseries.
